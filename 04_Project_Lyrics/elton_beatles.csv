Elton John,"I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner, in the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line

I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck, ooo
Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims
And the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so, ain't that so

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Meal ticket

Gotta get a meal ticket
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket"
Elton John,"Sitting here on Christmas Eve with a brandy in my hand
Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race

And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
The bearded weirdy's just arrived

Ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise
The bearded wierdy's just arrived

On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head
My vision's blurred with color, and all he sees is red
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room"
Elton John,"Oh, the joke was never hard to tell
Threw my spare change in the wishing well
The dream alone is always in your hands
If that don't fill the boy and build the man
A heart has many secrets, so I'm told
Through the years, a theory can grow cold
I'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear
The voice inside my head is the one I hear

Singing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again

The golden age was somehow bittersweet
But now the past lies sleepin' in the deep
The peaceful days that followed hollow nights
A kiss or touch could feel like Kryptonite
Praise the Saints that hung up on my wall
For trust is left in lovers after all
A whispered word emergin' from a tale
My wake-up call to claim the cursed spell

Well, I'm gonna love me again (love me again)
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again

Sing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again

I'm gonna love me again
I'm gonna love me again"
Elton John,"Oh it's great to see our homeland
Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here

We've made waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We are Spanish, not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground

There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We have seen the way the tide is turning
Cortez is a charlatan
We are on the ball, discerning
We're anti-diluvian
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two very modern samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man

There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
The things they never equip ships with
We have sailed into our last resort

There's no gold mine in the new world
It's a trick to get recruits
On the boat to El Dorado
We're returning to our roots
We're going back to land locked ladies
Cortez never letz them board
All in all the point we've made is
We don't want to go abroad
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man

Two very fine examples of
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth century man"
Elton John,"Hold up, y'all
Hold up
Not yet
Hold up

Now
Go 'head
Go 'head

Like that
Yeah
Mm

That's cool

Ooh

Bring it in
I heard that; come on, and play that back
I'm really feeling that; come on, smash track
It's just the regular two-man show

I heard that; come on, and play that back
I'm really feeling that; come on, smash track
It's just the regular two-man show

Doesn't it sound good to ya, don't you agree?
Doesn't it sound good to ya, don't you agree?

Come on, break it down
What
Huh
Oh

I heard that; come on, and play that back
I'm really feeling that; come on, smash track
It's just the regular two-man show

I heard that; come on, and play that back
I'm really feeling that; come on, smash track
It's just the regular two-man show

Oh

Doesn't it sound good to ya, don't you agree?
Doesn't it sound good to ya, don't you agree?

Listen to me right here

I like that
Gimmie, gimmie that
Come on

Take it to the high level
Go a lil' higher then that
Higher
Switch it up
I like that
I like that

Kill 'em

I like that
Grab yo' lady and hug her tight
Uh huh, uh huh

Shock value"
Elton John," I know everything changes
Yeah, it's strange how time marches on
Maybe there'll be some time in the future
Oh, tell me I'm not wrong

Oh, if I could stop time
It would be a frozen moment just around Christmas
When all of mankind reveals its truest potential
And there is sympathy for the suffering
Yes, there is sympathy for those who are suffering

And the world embraces peace and love and mercy
Instead of power and fear
And as sure as I'm standing here
I swear it really does appear that a change comes over us
Yes, some kind of change comes over us

And it's glimpsed for one shining moment
And this change feels like a change that's real
But then it passes along with the season
And then we just go back to the way we were
Yes, we just go back to the way we were

Say it isn't so
Tell me I'm not just a dreamer
I'm talking with a friend and he knows how it ends
He says it's easier, that's just the way we are
That's human nature and that's just the way we are
Oh, say it isn't so!
"
Elton John,"I can hear your heart
Pounding in my ear
Now I feel the sound
And the time is near
I feel the taste
Of all the things you do
Now the time has come
I know you're a dream come true

You make me so complete
With the things you do
And the music's sweet
You make me feel brand new
I hear the sound
Songs start coming through
Somehow I know
That you're a dream come true

It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every day
And life is good
Each and every way

Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And the blues are through
And now I know
What I'm gonna do
Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And all the blues are through
Now I know
What I'm gonna do

It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every way
And life is good
Each and every day"
Elton John,"Don't shy away from coming in
Closer still my darling friend
Don't slip, don't trip on life
I bear the moon
Inside your eyes
Don't be afraid of all my years
What you see or what you hear
It's all yours and yours and yours alone
Yours for the taking, so take it home

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soulful woman tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

Oh sure it's cracked a time or two
But him and me, we pulled on through
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Some went through fast
Some went real slow
So take a chance, and take your time
Reading my face between the lines
I love real good, and I love you
My heart and me
That's what we do

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soulful women tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soulful woman tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart, from me to you
Oh it's a good heart, from me to you"
Elton John,"It's so strange he doesn't show me more affection than he needs
Almost formal, too respectful, never takes romantic leads
There are times when I imagine I'm not always on his mind
He's not thinking what I'm thinking, always half a beat behind
Always half a beat behind

I'm in every kind of trouble, can't you tell, just look at me
Half ecstatic, half dejected, all in all I'm all at sea
Easy turns I thought I wanted, fill me now with chilling dread
You can never know the chaos, of a life turned on it's head
Of a life turned on it's head

Take a little time to panic, shake off your complacent state
I know all I ever wished to, of a life destroyed by fate
It's so strange you never notice anything but where you are
Step outside your gleaming prison, or is that a step too far
Or is that a step too far

"
Elton John,"Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said I'm gonna keep this good luck piece
Of iron inside my truck
The boy just whispered OK
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog

Dull as a plowshare rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show,
For a dollar and a half

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
Gone to California
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that west bound stage

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee"
Elton John,"Where have you been are you still on my side
Is that love or regret that I see in your eyes
How many years have we played out this game
Every time we come close the answer's always the same

I guess some souls get restless under the skin
There's a shortage by half of marrying men
You know that I love you but I love to be free
So tell me what do you want, yeah from a gypsy like me

I need a ring on my finger, champagne on ice
One man to show me the best part of life
Is that what you want
Yeah, that's what I need

A home and a family makes sense for us
A solid foundation built out of trust
Do you think you can find that with someone like me
Two arms to hold you, one place to be
Are just some of the things that a woman needs

I've been shortchanged and cheated so many times
But you're all that I've wanted For all of my life
I've searched for the reasons, known how I've felt
But what can I give you when I can't trust myself"
Elton John,"I don't know why
I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost

If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen

And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish

If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist

When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue"
Elton John,"Abide with me, fast forth the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
I triumph still if Thou abide with me

Hold Thou thy cross before my closen eyes
Shine throught the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me"
Elton John,"This ain't no battle honey, this ain't no fight
How come you take it so hard when I stay out all night
If I take a drink, is that against the law
And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war

Well you better believe it boy, this house is your home
I didn't build it up for you to live here on my own
And if you think it's easy to forget about me
You'd better think twice, you'd better believe it's an act of war

We're living on the front line you and me
Fighting on this battleground of misery
Oh go ahead bring on your artillery
And we'll make this an act of war
Give it all you've got `cause I'm all dug in
Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
Winner takes all, let the best man win
And we call it an act of war

Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
After twelve long hours ain't I got the right to play
If living together is getting in the way
Then I call that an act of war

Well if that's your game then honey two can play
I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my way
Ain't no way baby this girl's gonna stay
I call it, I call it an act of war

And it looks like time ain't been on our side
If we could turn the clock back
We might survive this act of war"
Elton John,"So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
With a song I just wrote yesterday
And I hope you can hear
What the words and the music have to say.

It's so hard to explain
Everything that I'm feelin'
Face to face I just seem to go dry.
But I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high.

Thanks for takin' me
On a one way trip to the sun.
And thanks for turnin' me
Into someone.

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes.
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.

And I know that my song
Isn't sayin' anything new.
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you.

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes.
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.

And I know that my song
Isn't sayin' anything new.
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you.

Yes, after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you.

Hmmm, after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you."
Elton John,"Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame

I read your letters when you're not near me
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear
I play the game, a fantasy
I pretend I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's get together

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing"
Elton John,"The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through"
Elton John,"All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise"
Elton John,"Breaking down
Never seems to be that hard
Falling short
Is always in the cards
I'm on the road
Sun rising at my back
Lost it all
Somewhere between the cracks

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

Leaving town
Gets to feel just like a job
My desire
Never winds up on top
I can't say now
I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach
Somewhere beyond this room

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

I've always tried to make things clear
Then I watched as progress stalled
I only hope I'm standing here
When Heaven finally comes to call

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

Thankful; I'm thankful;
So thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

All that I'm allowed

I'm thankful
And I've got all that I'm allowed
So thankful
And I've got all that I'm allowed"

Elton John,"Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double-barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues

Reality it seems, was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen?
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) you know what I mean

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday they found you in the subway dead

And who could you call your friends down in Soho?
One or two middle-aged dykes in a Go-Go
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) oh don't you know?

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away"
Elton John,"If it came to pass that they should ask
What could I tell them
Would they criticize behind my back
Maybe I should let them
Oh if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

If they could face it
I could take it in their eyes
Oh I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it
Oh if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

But I know the way they want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul

Elton John,"You know it, it is only true
That you could be the best of you
How I wonder miles away
Tying horseshoes by the bay

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Many say and lucky do
My own fire once said it too
Leave the ocean live and play
Door on sockets yesterday

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Is it fair or nestled sorrow
You could be there tomorrow

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Whooo

Whooo

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso"
Elton John,"Well, we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem, they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line
Well, our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown

But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

Well, we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved

So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No, they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke
Chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown

But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face

Well, I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today

Hey, hey, hey, oh, oh
And it's getting very hard to stay
And we're living here in Allentown"
Elton John,"You're a cool little one
My dark southern breeze
Sweeps through my fingers
And it amazes me

Dixie shadowland
Your envy shelters me
Lay down your burden
Mystery of ebony

And it amazes me
Oh it amazes me
Maybe the heat babe could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon

Look up that pale light
Well she's waking the trees
I'm drifting in your hoodoo
And it amazes me

That magnolia state
Got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just Mississippi company

Ain't no magic potion
No gri-gri on her side
She's bound to my salvation
Sweet little mama
Take me down by the river tonight
And it amazes me"
Elton John,"Deaf Dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad.

Ten years old
With thoughts as bold as thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

A vague haze of delerium
creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparked

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
Nothing to say and nothing to hear

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know.

Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride.

Sparks"
Elton John,"Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 

See the little baby 
Wrapped in a manger 
On Christmas Morning 
Amen, Amen, Amen 

See him in the Temple 
Talking with the Elders 
Tomorrows Wisdom 
Amen, Amen, Amen 
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 

Down at the Jordan 
And John was baptising 
And Savin' all sinners 
Amen, Amen, Amen 

See 'em at the Seaside 
Talking with the fisherman 
And makin' disciples 
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 

Sing it through the mountains"
Elton John,"Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt

Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence

It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands

Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent"
Elton John,"Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy, like a puppy child"
Elton John,"Tread on my face if you like little lady
Turn me inside out if you have to baby
But don't you cross me off your list
Ooo I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy

You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my neck 'cause I love you all the same

Amy I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy

Amy I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy

I'm beaten on the streets 'cause I loves ya
I watch you go to work in the summer
I don't whistle at you down the street
I would if I could but I can't whistle you see

Amy I may not be James Dean
Amy I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooo ooo, Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams

Amy I may not be James Dean
Amy I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooo ooo, Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams"
Elton John,"The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town

Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish that I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread

[Chorus:]
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time

[Chorus]

So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

[Chorus]

And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down"
Elton John,"Well, I'm work shy, I'm wild-eyed
So shut that door when the baby cries
Keep me well fed, give me warm bread
Lay my body on a feather bed

And spoil me, Angeline, get to work
When the whistle screams, Angeline

Maybe someday, some way
Somewhere in the future there's more pay
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash

And bite me, Angeline, let me use
You like a sex machine, Angeline

You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean, Angeline

Well, I talk tough, I act rough
Lay still honey, I can't get enough
And keep your nose clean, let me be
On your knees when you speak to me

And trust me, Angeline and talk real dirty
And I'll make you scream, Angeline

You've got to swing that hammer and punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean

You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean

Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean
Angeline, Angeline, treat her mean, Angeline
Treat her mean, Angeline, treat her mean, Angeline

Elton John,"There's a place in the world  for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
And he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 

Give a moment or two to the angry young man 
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand 
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood 
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good 
He sits in a room with a lock on the door 
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 

I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage, 
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight 
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view 
Life went on no matter who was right or wrong. 

And there's always a place for the angry young man 
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand 
He's never been able to learn from mistakes 
He can't understand why his heart always breaks 
His honor is pure, and his courage as well 
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell 
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man. 

There's a place in the world  for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
And he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man."
Elton John,"Well they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope in sight
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky

Well they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold onto something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown
All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky"
Elton John,"Anyone who ever loved
Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do

Every time you go away
I always say it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you, I'd die dear
Knowing I love you so

Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you've hurt me
And be so untrue
So what can I do

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue

Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And, and always love me, and love me, love me
Why won't you

Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me
Anyone would take me
Why, why won't you
No one's gonna love ya like I do
No one's gonna make you feel the way I do
Yeah
No one
No one, no one, no one, no one"
Elton John,"Catch a star if you can
Wish for something special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listenin'
One melody, you're all for me

I'll write a symphony
Just for you & me
If you let me love you
I'll paint a masterpiece
Just for you to see
If you let me love you
Let me love you.
            
[Chorus]
Are you ready, are you ready for love
Yes I am
Are you, are you ready,
Are you ready for love
Yes I am
Are you, are you ready
Are you ready for love
You're the one, like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be, the one for me
Say the world, and I'll be there
Loving you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so

We'll hear the music ring
From the mountain tops
To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world
With a lullaby
So the angels will know us
Angels will know us

[Chorus]

[Chorus]"
Elton John,"Written by Thom Bell, Leroy Bell and Casey James
Catch a star if you can

Elton John,"Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC 
Didn't get to bed last night 
Oh, the way the paper bag was on my knee 
Man, I had a dreadful flight 
I'm back in the USSR 
You don't know how lucky you are, boy 
Back in the USSR, yeah 

Been away so long I hardly knew the place 
Gee, it's good to be back home 
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case 
Honey disconnect the phone 
I'm back in the USSR 
You don't know how lucky you are, boy 
Back in the US 
Back in the US 
Back in the USSR 

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out 
They leave the west behind 
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout 
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind 
Oh, come on 
Hu hey hu, hey, ah, yeah 
yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm back in the USSR 
You don't know how lucky you are, boys 
Back in the USSR 

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out 
They leave the west behind 
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout 
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind 

Oh, show me round your snow peaked 
mountain way down south 
Take me to you daddy's farm 
Let me hear you balalaika's ringing out 
Come and keep your comrade warm 
I'm back in the USSR 
Hey, You don't know how lucky you are, boy 
Back in the USSR 
Oh, let me tell you honey"
Elton John,"It coulda been me but it was you
Who went and bit off a little bit more than he could chew
You said that you had it made, but you been had
The woman no good, no how, thinkin' maybe the blood is bad

Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)
The woman was born to lie
Makes promises she can't keep
With the wink on an eye

Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)
Brother, you've been deceived
It's bound to change you mind
About all you believe

From where I stand, it looks mighty strange
How you let a woman like that treat you like small change
I don't understand what you're lookin' to find
The only thing bad blood do is mess up a good man's mind

Hear me talkin' now

Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)
Is takin' you for a ride
The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide

Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron
Bad blood, talkin' 'bout bad blood

Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di, dit, dit, ron-ron
Bad blood
Here we go

Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Bad (ba-a-ad) blood (blo-o-od)

The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide

The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide"
Elton John,"It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon, yeah

Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life (yeah-eh)
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life

There ain't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon

And I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
And I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

Who's in my life, who's in my life (yeah-eh), who's in my life (oh)
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life 
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life

Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life
Who's in my life, who's in my life, who's in my life"
Elton John,"I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
And if it's all the same maybe we should part
And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do

You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out

Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly
Driving me insane
Oh oui baby

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

I couldn't take your pain, you couldn't take my love
So I'm gonna quit this game 'cause baby I've had enough"
Elton John,"I pulled out my stage coach times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew

The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And hung my head in shame

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast

The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now they've found me
Lord I say at last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Lord I say now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Lord I say now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun"
Elton John,"I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight

Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore

Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time

They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen"
Elton John,"Deep inside
My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes, Belfast.

Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rock and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place, Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

Who's to say
On whom Heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try harder to recognize
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down,
Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

The enemy is not at home
A jealous green
Streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver place,
Belfast."
Elton John,"I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later
But love, I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone
Without love, I believe in love

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me
Without love

I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love"
Elton John,"No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside, me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside, me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
(I can feel something inside, me say)
(I really don't think you're strong enough, no)

What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you?
Well I can't do that
There's no turning back

I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
Cause I got time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside, me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside, me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
(I can feel something inside, me say)
(I really don't think you're strong enough, no)

Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside, me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside, me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no"

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out,
Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh, yeah
Bennie and the Jets

She's so good
She's so good, yeah
Yeah
Alright

Hey kid, plug into the faithless (to the faithless)
Maybe they're blinded
Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along (let us take ourselves along)
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find out who's right and who's wrong

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Ooh, but they're so spaced out yeah
But Bennie and the Jets
Yeah, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, and Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots (electric boots)
A mohair suit (a mohair suit)
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
Bennie and the Jets

Better keep one road and heard she's back
In a mohair suit signing autographs
She hates the media, it brings her down
But when you decide you gonna need your fans
Make a flip flop when your CD out
She was sitting up but you'll need it now
You believe in luck, ?
'cause either way you gonna need it now, now
They can build you up so they can break you down, yeah
Cry tears of joy so they can see you drown, yeah
Chew you up and then they spit you out
You are now a victim of the crowd, and music's lost its soul
And the female's selling sex and no concern in getting more
So they concerts on they souls
So they concerts on they labels
That we pay them to perform
See, the way this game is set up
We can't let this show go on, no
We gonna love the when the party's over
I'm saying everybody love 'em but nobody know 'em
I'm saying everybody know you but nobody need you
So will she still be in your heart when she ain't in your speakers?

Sure, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out,
Bennie and the Jets, yeah
Oh, yeah but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Oh Bennie and the Jets yeah

Yeah, she makes the mohair suit look so good
So good

Rock on, alright
Wild times
Right time"
Elton John,"She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something that's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Uh but they're so spaced out, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Let me get it now, Momma I made it
True story, I have upgraded
Everybody back then used to hate it
Now they all appreciate it
I might sound out of my mind, matter of fact out of line
But I been runnin' and gunnin', been fightin' for somethin' and in due time
I'm finna take it to the line, I'm in the beginning of the prime
Tony Montana the world's mine
Yeah, it's finally 'bout time
Went from Section 8 to better times
Serving food to writin' rhymes
For Elton John, the greatest of all-time

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out

Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, and the Jets, yeah, oh"
Elton John,"There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead, if you haven't yet died"
Elton John,"I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight
Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead
Close to you instead

I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay

And if I shower around 3 a.m.
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh in the times I went astray
The times I went astray

So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen"
Elton John,"They'll tear out your heart, throw it knee-deep in a cart
'cause that's what they do with the scum like me and you
And you feel as if you died, whilst you're standing on the line
And you wonder all the time why can't you cry?
But the people in control don't care for you
They're just a robot with a job to do
And when your use is exhausted, they'll be rid of you
As soon as look at you, go to the back of the queue!

be-be-Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick him in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick him in the ah (sh) ah (sh) ah (sh) ah (sh) arse

His eyes are dull, they stole his soul
They left him to rot in some stinking council hole
Where they keep him doped on beer and hopes
Of television dreams he's living on the screens
He knows something that he used to believe in
That was: Every human being should have his freedom
But while his dungeon had a way to show him
He should be more useful, as they broke into his skull

be-be-Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick him in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick him in the ah (sh) ah (sh) ah (sh) ah (sh) arse

Big brother, beware, 'cause some of us do care
And the worm (and the worm, and the worm, and the worm)
May turn (may turn, may turn, may turn)
And the violence (and the violence, and the violence, and the violence)
In my head (in my head, in my head, in my head) is real
Bam-bam, you're dead!

be-be-Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick him in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

"
Elton John,"Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours

So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks

He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more

Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours

Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper"
Elton John,"You went uptown riding in your limousine
In your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And the spoon up your nose
And when you wake up in the morning
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me

Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You and to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night

They were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained
But now you just can't remember
All the things you said
And you're not sure you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You hand to the last word, last night
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night

Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
So much fun to be around
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night"
Elton John,"Take the wheel I hear the timbers creaking
Take the wheel I think this ship is sinking
Jamaica seems so far and I've been thinking
Old Billy Bones has gone to sea and quit his dockside drinking

Check it out, check it out, check it out

And when I'm dead who'll fly the White Bird home
I'm not the ancient mariner your children know
And the sea's the field these old jack tars have sown
Cause Billy Bones just wants to know who'll fly the White Bird home

Oh your majesty, your majesty
I heard the boson cry
Old Billy Bones has washed ashore
Upon a foreign tide"
Elton John,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
DonÂ´t answer the question of what I am to you"
Elton John,"I was justified when I was five
Raisin' Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changin' now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back, oh, oh, oh

Eat meat on a Friday, that's all right
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, oh, oh, oh

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do oh

I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul, by dropping names
I don't like those! My God, what's that!
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back.

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do oh

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do oh

Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, the bitch is back"
Elton John,"She slid down to the city limits
Monkey time in fifteen minutes
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.
Don't let me down
Please stick around
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.

Strobe light on funky feet,
Soul children in the disco heat.
Top dog, top cat,
Move that muscle and shake that fat.
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.

Chicago, L.A.
Everyplace, everyway
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.

Illinois, Santa Fe,
Do do do do do do do what I say
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance."
Elton John,"I'm going on the circuit, I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song boys to stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney

Oh could you knock a line or two together for a friend
Sentimental tear inducing with a happy end
And we need a tune to open our season at Southend
Can you help us

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

I like the warm blue flame, the hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles and forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run from the tin pan alley twins

And there's a chance that one day you might write a standard lads
So churn them out quick and fast and we'll still pat your backs
'Cause we need what we can get to launch another dozen acts
Are you working

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

La-de-das, swing stars, swinging stars
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing"
Elton John,"I am the Blackman and you are the white
I am the deviant and you're always right
I am the darkness and you are the light
I am the Blackman, you're the white

Yeah, I'm the good little holier than thou, hide my head in my hand
I hear no, see no, speak no, no, no, no understand

Well, I am the blackness, I am the dark
I am the alcoholic beast in a park
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite

I am the dirty and you are the clean
I live in places where you've never been
I eat the garbage and you eat the cream
I am the dirty, you're the clean

You give me the third degree for being different to thee
You hit me, you kick me, you tell me [Incomprehensible] I should be

Well, I am the blackness, I am the dark
I am the alcoholic beast in a park
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite

I am the white man, I paint you black
I am the traitor but I put you on the whack
I am the coward, I shoot you in the back
I am the white man, I paint you black

Yeah, I'm the good little holier than thou, hide my head in my hand
I hear no, see no, speak no, no, no, no understand

Well, I am the blackness, I am the dark
I am the alcoholic beast in a park
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite

Say I am the blackness, I am the dark
I am the alcoholic beast in a park
I am the girl who sold her body to the dark
I am the truth of it, you are the hypocrite

Elton John,"Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed

I know you're still just a dream
your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed

And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky

Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed

I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed"
Elton John,"I gotta quit this habit
It's like some drug for you
You've been my sweet sweet addict
I've been your little white boy blue

You've got the same obsession
We ain't no cat and mouse
You linger on my lips like confession
You laid the traps in this house

And it's no use each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck babe
Up on Blue Avenue
Up on Blue Avenue
Blue Avenue

Two hearts get entangled
Dirty minds they go to town
Everyone's got an angle
Little lies get spread around

Let them say what they want
You and me we already knew
Takes more than hocus pocus babe
To save you from Blue Avenue"
Elton John,"Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep blue sea
On a blue blue day

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the morning comes
I'll be far away
And I say

Blue eyes holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone
Again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me

Blue eyes
Ooh I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again

Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again"

The Beatles,"I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on"
The Beatles,"""Dub the mic on the piano quite low this
Just keeping it like maracas, you know
You know those old pianos""

The Beatles,"It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log

The Beatles,"All I've got is a picture of you
Now that you've gone and left me blue
You don't hear me cry at night
And say sweet things to you
You don't hear me sing a love song to
A picture of you

I pretend that you're still here with me
Laughing just the way we used to be
But pictures they can't talk and they can't see
I know I'm in love and nothing more
Nothing more

I hope you'll be happy where you are
But if you need me I won't be to far
Standing in the shadow of my dreams
They say it's not as bad as it may seem
But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do
They don't realise that all I got
Is a picture of you"
The Beatles,"Well, if your hands start a-clappin' 
And your fingers start a-poppin'

And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down 
You feel like you gotta move around 

You get a shot of rhythm and blues.

Just for good measure. 
Get a pair of dancin' shoes 

Well, with your lover by your side 
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, see'mon!

Tasting much sweeter than wine

Do do do
Do do do

I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey (a taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

Do do do
Do do do

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
That taste of honey, a taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back (he'll come back)
For the honey (for the honey)
And you"
The Beatles,"A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine. 

I dream of your first kiss, and then, 
I feel upon my lips again, 
A taste of honey...tasting much sweeter than wine. 

I will return, yes I will return, 
I'll come back for the honey and you. 

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart, 
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart, 
That taste of honey...tasting much sweeter than wine. 

I will return, yes I will return, 
I'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you."
The Beatles,"Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless, undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva"
The Beatles,"They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin' down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally"
The Beatles,"Oh, ain't she sweet?
Well, see her walking down that street
Yes, I ask you very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?

Oh, ain't she nice?
Well, look her over once or twice
Yes, I ask you very confidentially

The Beatles,"Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I gotta do

And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissing you

And the same goes for me

The Beatles,"Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my lovin' to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my lovin' to you

All my lovin', I will send to you
All my lovin', darlin', I'll be true

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you

All my lovin', darlin', I'll be true
All my lovin', all my lovin'
Ooh ooh, all my lovin', I will send to you"
The Beatles,"Sunrise doesn't last all morning, 
A cloudburst doesn't last all day. 
Seems my love is up 
And has left you with no warning.
It's not always been this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 

Sunset doesn't last all evening, 
A mind can blow those clouds away. 
After all this my love is up 
And must be leaving. 
It has not always been this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 

All things must pass 
None of life's strings can last. 
So I must be on my way, 
Face another day. 

Darkness only stays at nighttime, 
In the morning it will fade away. 
Daylight is good 
At arriving at the right time. 
It's not always 
Will to be this grey. 

All things must pass, 
All things must pass away. 
All things must pass, 
All things must pass away."

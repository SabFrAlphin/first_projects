Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race

And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
The bearded weirdy's just arrived

Ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise
The bearded wierdy's just arrived

On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head
My vision's blurred with color, and all he sees is red
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room"

The dream alone is always in your hands
If that don't fill the boy and build the man
A heart has many secrets, so I'm told
Through the years, a theory can grow cold
I'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear
The voice inside my head is the one I hear

Singing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again

The golden age was somehow bittersweet
But now the past lies sleepin' in the deep
The peaceful days that followed hollow nights
A kiss or touch could feel like Kryptonite
Praise the Saints that hung up on my wall
For trust is left in lovers after all
A whispered word emergin' from a tale
My wake-up call to claim the cursed spell

Well, I'm gonna love me again (love me again)

Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here

We've made waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We are Spanish, not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground

There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We have seen the way the tide is turning
Cortez is a charlatan
We are on the ball, discerning
We're anti-diluvian
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two very modern samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man

There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
The things they never equip ships with
We have sailed into our last resort

There's no gold mine in the new world
It's a trick to get recruits
On the boat to El Dorado
We're returning to our roots
We're going back to land locked ladies
Cortez never letz them board

Shock value"
21," I know everything changes
Yeah, it's strange how time marches on
Maybe there'll be some time in the future
Oh, tell me I'm not wrong

Oh, if I could stop time
It would be a frozen moment just around Christmas
When all of mankind reveals its truest potential
And there is sympathy for the suffering
Yes, there is sympathy for those who are suffering

And the world embraces peace and love and mercy
Instead of power and fear
And as sure as I'm standing here
I swear it really does appear that a change comes over us
Yes, some kind of change comes over us

And it's glimpsed for one shining moment
And this change feels like a change that's real
But then it passes along with the season
And then we just go back to the way we were
Yes, we just go back to the way we were

Say it isn't so
Tell me I'm not just a dreamer
I'm talking with a friend and he knows how it ends
He says it's easier, that's just the way we are
That's human nature and that's just the way we are
Oh, say it isn't so!

Pounding in my ear
Now I feel the sound
And the time is near
I feel the taste
Of all the things you do
Now the time has come
I know you're a dream come true

You make me so complete
With the things you do
And the music's sweet
You make me feel brand new
I hear the sound
Songs start coming through
Somehow I know
That you're a dream come true

It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every day
And life is good
Each and every way

Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And the blues are through
And now I know
What I'm gonna do
Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And all the blues are through

24,"Don't shy away from coming in
Closer still my darling friend
Don't slip, don't trip on life
I bear the moon
Inside your eyes
Don't be afraid of all my years
What you see or what you hear
It's all yours and yours and yours alone
Yours for the taking, so take it home

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soulful woman tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

Oh sure it's cracked a time or two
But him and me, we pulled on through
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Some went through fast
Some went real slow
So take a chance, and take your time
Reading my face between the lines
I love real good, and I love you
My heart and me
That's what we do

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soulful women tend to love
The kind of love you never knew

26,"It's so strange he doesn't show me more affection than he needs
Almost formal, too respectful, never takes romantic leads
There are times when I imagine I'm not always on his mind
He's not thinking what I'm thinking, always half a beat behind
Always half a beat behind

I'm in every kind of trouble, can't you tell, just look at me
Half ecstatic, half dejected, all in all I'm all at sea
Easy turns I thought I wanted, fill me now with chilling dread
You can never know the chaos, of a life turned on it's head
Of a life turned on it's head

Take a little time to panic, shake off your complacent state
I know all I ever wished to, of a life destroyed by fate
It's so strange you never notice anything but where you are
Step outside your gleaming prison, or is that a step too far
Or is that a step too far

27,"Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said I'm gonna keep this good luck piece
Of iron inside my truck
The boy just whispered OK
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog

Dull as a plowshare rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show,
For a dollar and a half

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
Gone to California
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that west bound stage

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy

A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

31,"Where have you been are you still on my side
Is that love or regret that I see in your eyes
How many years have we played out this game
Every time we come close the answer's always the same

I guess some souls get restless under the skin
There's a shortage by half of marrying men
You know that I love you but I love to be free
So tell me what do you want, yeah from a gypsy like me

I need a ring on my finger, champagne on ice
One man to show me the best part of life
Is that what you want
Yeah, that's what I need

A home and a family makes sense for us
A solid foundation built out of trust
Do you think you can find that with someone like me
Two arms to hold you, one place to be
Are just some of the things that a woman needs

I've been shortchanged and cheated so many times
But you're all that I've wanted For all of my life
I've searched for the reasons, known how I've felt
But what can I give you when I can't trust myself"

I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost

If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen

And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish

If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist

When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue"

The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
I triumph still if Thou abide with me

Hold Thou thy cross before my closen eyes
Shine throught the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me"

Face to face I just seem to go dry.
But I love you so much

On a one way trip to the sun.
And thanks for turnin' me
Into someone.

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes.
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.

And I know that my song
Isn't sayin' anything new.
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you.

Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through"

47,"The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through"

49,"All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise"

Never seems to be that hard
Falling short
Is always in the cards
I'm on the road
Sun rising at my back
Lost it all
Somewhere between the cracks

It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday they found you in the subway dead

And who could you call your friends down in Soho?
One or two middle-aged dykes in a Go-Go
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) oh don't you know?

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away"

That you could be the best of you
How I wonder miles away
Tying horseshoes by the bay

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Many say and lucky do
My own fire once said it too
Leave the ocean live and play
Door on sockets yesterday

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Is it fair or nestled sorrow
You could be there tomorrow

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Whooo

Whooo

81,"Well, we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem, they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line
Well, our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown

But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

Well, we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved

So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No, they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke
Chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown

But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face

Well, I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today

Hey, hey, hey, oh, oh
And it's getting very hard to stay
And we're living here in Allentown"

Maybe the heat babe could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon

Look up that pale light
Well she's waking the trees
I'm drifting in your hoodoo
And it amazes me

That magnolia state
Got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just Mississippi company

Ain't no magic potion
No gri-gri on her side
She's bound to my salvation
Sweet little mama
Take me down by the river tonight
And it amazes me"

Hate what we don't understand

To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent"

110,"The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town

Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish that I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread

[Chorus:]
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time

[Chorus]

So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

[Chorus]

And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down"
111,"Well, I'm work shy, I'm wild-eyed
So shut that door when the baby cries
Keep me well fed, give me warm bread
Lay my body on a feather bed

And spoil me, Angeline, get to work
When the whistle screams, Angeline

Maybe someday, some way
Somewhere in the future there's more pay
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash

And bite me, Angeline, let me use
You like a sex machine, Angeline

You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean, Angeline

Well, I talk tough, I act rough
Lay still honey, I can't get enough
And keep your nose clean, let me be
On your knees when you speak to me

And trust me, Angeline and talk real dirty
And I'll make you scream, Angeline

You've got to swing that hammer and punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean

You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans

Angeline, Angeline, treat her mean, Angeline
Treat her mean, Angeline, treat her mean, Angeline
"
112,"There's a place in the world  for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
And he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 

Give a moment or two to the angry young man 
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand 
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood 
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good 
He sits in a room with a lock on the door 
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 

I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage, 
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight 
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view 
Life went on no matter who was right or wrong. 

And there's always a place for the angry young man 
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand 
He's never been able to learn from mistakes 
He can't understand why his heart always breaks 
His honor is pure, and his courage as well 
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell 
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man. 

There's a place in the world  for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
And he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man."
113,"Well they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope in sight
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky

Well they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold onto something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown
All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

Makes promises she can't keep

About all you believe

From where I stand, it looks mighty strange
How you let a woman like that treat you like small change

Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight

Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore

Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time

They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen"

181,"Deep inside
My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes, Belfast.

Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rock and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place, Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

Who's to say
On whom Heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try harder to recognize
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down,
Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

The enemy is not at home
A jealous green
Streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver place,
Belfast."

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger

And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight

The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease streaked windows of an all night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead, if you haven't yet died"

Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead
Close to you instead

I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay

And if I shower around 3 a.m.
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh in the times I went astray
The times I went astray

So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen"
327,"They'll tear out your heart, throw it knee-deep in a cart
'cause that's what they do with the scum like me and you
And you feel as if you died, whilst you're standing on the line
And you wonder all the time why can't you cry?
But the people in control don't care for you
They're just a robot with a job to do
And when your use is exhausted, they'll be rid of you
As soon as look at you, go to the back of the queue!

be-be-Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick him in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick him in the ah (sh) ah (sh) ah (sh) ah (sh) arse

His eyes are dull, they stole his soul
They left him to rot in some stinking council hole
Where they keep him doped on beer and hopes
Of television dreams he's living on the screens
He knows something that he used to believe in
That was: Every human being should have his freedom
But while his dungeon had a way to show him
He should be more useful, as they broke into his skull

be-be-Big brother's got no heart
When I get my chance
I'm gonna kick him in the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Big brother's got no heart

Big brother, beware, 'cause some of us do care
And the worm (and the worm, and the worm, and the worm)
May turn (may turn, may turn, may turn)
And the violence (and the violence, and the violence, and the violence)
In my head (in my head, in my head, in my head) is real
Bam-bam, you're dead!

328,"Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours

So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks

He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more

Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours

Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper"

330,"You went uptown riding in your limousine
In your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And the spoon up your nose
And when you wake up in the morning
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me

Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You and to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night

They were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained
But now you just can't remember
All the things you said
And you're not sure you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You hand to the last word, last night
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night

Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
So much fun to be around

Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past

Always look for a quiet place to hide

349,"I'm going on the circuit, I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song boys to stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney

Oh could you knock a line or two together for a friend
Sentimental tear inducing with a happy end
And we need a tune to open our season at Southend
Can you help us

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

I like the warm blue flame, the hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles and forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run from the tin pan alley twins

And there's a chance that one day you might write a standard lads
So churn them out quick and fast and we'll still pat your backs
'Cause we need what we can get to launch another dozen acts
Are you working

# Titanic Survival competition

### Description
- Kaggle competition on bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world
- My focus for this project was to build and train a linear regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle data set, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time- and weather-related features



### The Challenge
- The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded
- Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city
- In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.
- Models are evaluated based on the RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error)

### Core Technical Concept
1. file [bike_data_exploration] focusses on review of the training set and visually exploring the raw data to find correlations
2. file [bike_machine_learning] follows a machine learning workflow to
(A) feature engineer the data, (B) train the model, (C) test the model and (D) upload a data set to kaggle
